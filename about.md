Title: About the International Criminal Justice Consortium
 
"International Criminal Justice Consortium (ICJC)
The ICJC is an independent, nonpartisan alliance of international organisations committed to the support of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and international criminal justice at the national level. The work of the ICJC is pro bono, confidential, and driven by the client. The ICJC works with the ICC or national jurisdiction to identify, develop, and implement capacity building activities such as practical legal skills workshops, exchanges of expertise retreats, comparative legal analysis, and other similar collaborations.
 
Expansive Resources, Varied Perspectives
The collective membership of the ICJC is able to draw upon outstanding judicial, prosecutorial, legal and administrative practitioners from legal traditions and regions throughout the world. ICJC members are able to provide perspectives from varied professional, judicial and legal organisations, academic institutions, training academies, and human rights groups. ICJC members also are able to convene events within The Hague, throughout Europe, and around the world.
 
Independent and Flexible
An independent and impartial resource of practical support, the ICJC focuses on best practices sharing, not political agendas.
 
Sustainable and Efficient Model of Support
The ICJC is institutionally-based, with member organisations formally joining the Consortium. The ICJC Steering Committee helps to streamline communication with and between the ICC or national jurisdictions and Consortium membership, ensuring that collaboration is efficiently developed and implemented."
 
I will get hyperlinks to you later...to make it easier, maybe they should just be put vertically on the left or right bar (depending on what you are doing).
